<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>
Fire.X Technology was invented in 1860 by Elias Montrose in London. It combined mechanical computation with early electrical circuits to create one of the first automated information processing systems. Early prototypes were used for astronomical calculations, cryptography, and symbolic computation.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
The original Fire.X system had a modular architecture, mechanical arithmetic engine, relay-based logic circuits, and primitive memory storage. Operators interacted through levers, dials, and indicator lights, allowing symbolic input and feedback. Despite frequent mechanical failures, it demonstrated continuous automated computation unprecedented for its time.
</p>

<h2>Influence</h2>
<p>
Although Fire.X was not widely adopted in the 19th century, its concepts influenced later electromechanical computers. The modular design, logic circuits, and feedback mechanisms anticipated principles used in mid-20th-century computing. Modern historians recognize Fire.X as a critical precursor to programmable digital computers.
</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>
Artifacts of Fire.X, including Montrose's notebooks and partial devices, are preserved in private collections and museums. The system is now studied for its innovative approach to computation and human-machine interaction.
